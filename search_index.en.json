a personal email thread on Gmail the geeks from CELPEC decided to mull over 5 things\n\n\n\nWhat 5 things in the last ten years have really made you jump out of your proverbial bath tub and run through the streets all excited?\nCorollary to (1), What 5 things have really been very useful for you in the last ten years? \nWhat 5 things you see as absolutely neurotic, or useless in the last ten years which have come about and are just not dying out!\nWhat 2-3 ( or more if your heart so desires ) things or innovations would really make a difference to your life?\n\nBeing a online community guy I decided to give it a shot on Beta Thoughts :D. So here it goes\nJump out of proverbial bath tub\n\nWifi – from the day I started using this, I am in love with this. Now a days I even stream video from my desktop to TV with a notebook on wifi connecting to desktop\nP2P – This is just amazing. Have you ever looked at the Detailed view in Azureus\nGoogle Earth – While it did make me jump when Guru demoed it to me while it was still keyhole. I used it a lot for doing my apartment search. But now that the novelty has worn off. I am back to Google Maps, if only they would implement A9’s proximity images in it\nDVD Backup – How easy it is these days to do it and once the DVD is in on the harddisk opportunities to modify the content are endless.\nModern Telecom – just the fact that I can talk, video conference, voip with any one with relatively ease still makes me jump from that damn tub. I talk over cell phone, AD conversion, communication with cell tower, base station, may be sattelite, may be fiber under see, voice reaches India, Ambala exchange, my home.

His analogy of pointing the difference between a laptop/notebook and Desktop is a good one and points to the loosely coupled and tightly coupled systems. There is another analogy I really like and I believe is a good one in explaining SOA to someone. It comes from Bernard Wheeler at Sun. Here it is in its entirety\n\nThe traditional relationship between business and IT is like having a personal chef: you (the business) can dictate what you want to eat, or take menu recommendations, but your chef (the IT department) only buys supplies according to the pre-agreed menu. You play no part in how the food is bought, cooked, etc., but you pay the whole cost for the chef, cooking fuel, food and all the waste from each meal. In addition, if you suddenly change your mind about what you want to eat, there’s unlikely to be an alternative meal ready in a short time – apart from re-cooked leftovers.\nUsing commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) software is more like eating in a restaurant: there’s typically less flexibility available to you in the actual make-up of the dishes and the more customization you want, the more it’ll cost. But you share the costs of the chef, facilities, etc. among other restaurant-goers – reaping some benefits from the ‘economies of scale’ of the restaurant. Furthermore, if you change your mind about what you want just before ordering (e.g. pizza vs. pasta), there’s probably a reasonable alternative that can be available in an acceptable amount of time. But if you want to include a totally different culture or flavor (e.g. vegetable tempura as a starter), you may have to visit more than one ‘restaurant’ and figure out for yourself the logistics of how the ‘meal’ as a whole is going to be achieved. Also, there’s nothing to stop the restaurant from suddenly hiking up their prices, radically changing their menu, or being bought out by a bigger chain who then ‘trashes’ your preferred meal.\nSOA is like eating at a buffet: the chef (either private or shared) prepares a range of dishes from which you build your own meal. The meal you choose does not require the whole ensemble to be put together ‘in the kitchen’: rather, the chef focuses solely on ensuring that there is an appropriate range of dishes provided in the buffet to keep most people happy for most of the time, based on market demand, season (and other prevailing conditions), consumer feedback/requests/suggestions, etc. And if the cost of any item changes dramatically (or there’s an ingredient shortage, “food scare”, or some other reason to change a menu choice), you don’t have to change your whole meal, just that one piece of it (although granted, it may be the centrepiece of the meal).\n\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/a-good-soa-analogy/","path":"/blog/a-good-soa-analogy/","title":"A Good SOA Analogy"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/a-little-thought-and-happy-diwali/":{"body":"Happy Diwali… Today is the festival of lights for Indians.

I was writing this to a close friend of mine and thought of putting it on the blog. This advice is a rather first step to decide which stream to join in SAP –\n\nTechnology Consulting – understanding the architecture of various SAP solutions and advising the IT department of clients on what is best for them and then helping them implement it. Your end customers in this case is always IT department people. This is purely technical job 😀 Folks who work in this area are called technology consultants. On the first day of project you can recognize these guys as someone who is wearing a suit but is uncomfortable in it.\nBusiness consulting – understanding the capabilities of SAP’s solutions and implementing them for the client’s business. For example let us say you manufacture bulbs – you have plants where you make them, you have suppliers who supply you materials, you have distributors who distribute your products and finally you have customers. Also don’t forget the employees. So you implement SAP solutions which take care of all these folks and the processes they are involved in. People who work in these areas are called functional consultants and they love to wear suits 😀\nSolution Delivery – both of the above activities could involve multi-month engagement with the end clients with a team of functional as well as technology consultants. This engagement would be called a project. There are folks whose main job is to deliver the on time within budget and scope delivery of these projects. These are your project managers. Usually PMs evolve organically from the above two roles. But you might see folks coming out of B-Schools directly jumping as PMs. This guy is a leader and can be seen very nervous during the first few days of the project 😉\n\nOnce you have decided one of the three above you can focus on a particular SAP product. I wrote this with SAP in mind but I think this would be true for any enterprise software product.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/advice-on-joining-the-sap-world/","path":"/blog/advice-on-joining-the-sap-world/","title":"Advice on joining the SAP world"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/airtel-call-home-misleading-1-cent-campaign/":{"body":"First a little background – I have used Airtel Call Home for calling India in the past and generally like their voice quality. They had also ran great introductory offers when they started which gave good run for the money to Reliance India Call – gold standard in India calling. Competition has been good in this market and has pushed the prices down considering it used to be 65-70 cents a minute when I came to US in 1999.\nNow to Airtel’s recent claim of 1 cents / minute call. How would you feel if you went to a shop for buying a pair of shoes and saw on display “Shoes for only $100” but later on realize the shoes are infact 66 % more i.e. they are really $166 not $100. This is what Airtel is doing with their 1 cents a minute promotion. Best is the use of phrase like “Rental Value”. If I buy a card for $10, $3.99 is deducted to provide “Rental Value” I wonder what value does the customer drives from this. Why did they choose to rephrase a charge as value. Is customer that dumb. And what was wrong with selling minutes for 1.66 cents per minute? It is still the lowest price I have seen in the Tier 1 India Calling card business and is half the price of what I am paying right now.

I am talking about the 3 Com Audrey I bought during 2001 for $99 after a friend from S’Pore called that it is available on tigerdirect. I loved it during those lean times. So the release of iPad brought back all those memories. While these thoughts were circling in my mind, kind folks on the interwebs have already written a post I wanted to write :D. Here is one snippet from that post\n\nAudrey is/was a $500.00 USD “Internet appliance” released by 3Com in 2000 that ran QNX – a popular embedded *nix-like OS. You could surf the web, listen to music and e-mail folks (plus run a few other apps that came with it). It had a touchscreen (tho, you needed a stylus) with a virtual keyboard, but you could also use a wireless keyboard. My setup is a bit worse for the wear, but she still works:\n\n   Uploaded with plasq‘s Skitch!\n\nThe device failed because it was too expensive and just a bit ahead of it’s time (you have to remember, the Internet was a different place back then, with the intended, primary means of connecting the Audrey being dial-up). I believe it also failed because there was no good way to develop for it, thus snubbing early adopters who might have been able to get 3Com over the 1st gen hump and provide it a stream of cool apps to make it worth the money for the general public.\n\nOn the internet nothing ever dies.

I am sure more than 50% folks were returning from Mandalay Bay. It was easily the biggest TechED so far with 6000 folks from all over the US, quite a few from outside US too. Attending the sessions you like and managing the schedule can be a lot of work – see right.\neSOA was the biggest theme this year and it was quite fun to participate in the Product Strategy workshops with Product Management folks. There were also quite a few sessions on Composition Environment. In fact Vishal Sikka’s keynote demoed some parts of the CE. Some of the other interesting things\n ADoW – ADoW or Application Delivery over WAN was announced last year and it was good to hear that SAP is using it internally for their portal. It is a software appliance to speed up the delivery of NetWeaver Applications over the long haul WANs like between continents and long distances. It is achieved by caching and bandwidth shaping etc.\n“New” Identity Management – is based on SAP’s new acquisition Maxware. This will be very useful and powerful tool in SAP’s portfolio. I can see this tool filling a lot of gaps I have seen on NetWeaver implementations. Virtual Directory Server (VDS) concept inside this tool is quite powerful. VDS can put a facade around most of the user stores like LDAP, DB, ABAP user stores. Right now this exists as a separate tool from NetWeaver. Hopefully SAP would be integrating this with NW pretty soon.&nbsp;\nVirtualization – is a recurrent theme which has been very hot in the last few years. VMWare and Intel were seen promoting this heavily and I attended a session on virtualization and Linux\nSDN Clubhouse – Not a technical thing but IMO clubhouse was the most fun place to be between the sessions. Cappuccinos and Mochas were excellent. Met a lot of interesting folks over here. Good to see Craig Cmehil, Mario Herger, Irfan Khan and Kartik Iyengar. There were a lot of activities going on like SAP demos on the pods, community theater, 5 partner stalls with lots of ipod touches to give :), check your basis skills in the back etc.\nOverall a fun and tiring TechEd.

Thanks to Bjorn Goerke for quoting this by Steinbeck which is so apt ( http://bgoerke.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/ive-never-seen-her-more-lovely/ )\nWhen I was a child growing up in Salinas we called San Francisco “the City”. Of course it was the only city we knew, but I still think of it as the City, and so does everyone else who has ever associated with it. A strange and exclusive word is “city”. Besides San Francisco, only small sections of London and Rome stay in the mind as the City. New Yorkers say they go to town. Paris has no title but Paris. Mexico City is the Capital.\nSan Francisco put on a show for me. I saw her across the bay, from the great road that bypasses Sausalito and enters the Golden Gate Bridge. The afternoon sun painted her white and gold rising on her hills like a noble city in a happy dream. A city on hills has it over flatland places. New York makes its own hills with craning buildings, but this gold and white acropolis rising wave on wave against the blue of the Pacific sky was a stunning thing, a painted thing like a picture of a medieval Italian city which can never have existed.\nI stopped in a parking place to look at her and the necklace bridge over the entrance from the sea that led to her. Over the green higher hills to the south, the evening fog rolled like herds of sheep coming to cote in the golden city. I’ve never seen her more lovely. When I was a child and we were going to the City, I couldn’t sleep for several nights before, out of bursting excitement.

Cases in point â€“ Googleâ€™s Gmail, and Microsoftâ€™s Longhorn, SAPâ€™s Netweaver, and MoveableTypeâ€™s 3.0. By making the product available to select few a group of haves and have-nots is created. There by creating an anxiety in the tech community. This serves the software vendors very well as an effective brand awareness and marketing tool.

Then I noticed the first bridge and thought that must be San Mateo 92 bridge. But then the 2nd bridge became visible and I could make out that 1st one must be Dumbartan bridge and this one is San Mateo bridge. Now it became clear that flight took the path of flying over south bay, east bay parallel to 880 north. So next I could see bay bridge and SF downdown lights and said wow. Now my eyes started looking for Golden Gate and San Rafael bridge and lo and behold you could see them both. Infact you could see San Quentin prison lights at the end of San Rafael bridge.\nI thought to my self the only bridge to be seen now is Benecia bridge near Fairfield. I could see two very close small parallel bridges but wasn’t sure if they are the ones I am looking for. Since I cross Benecia bridge every two week I knew the landmarks to look for. When you are driving over the bridge you could see these big parked boats and I spotted them from the air.

This post is related to that. Here I would share my thoughts with blurbs from already published articles of this series. Make sure to read all the articles published in this series over here.\nHas it already been five years? Doesnâ€™t feel like it. Seriously. In retrospective when I think, my first hint of the bubble should have been when I had put my resume as a Java Developer on dice.com (it might still be there) I was living a serene life in Louisville KY, and then being a geek, I felt the pull of Silicon Valley during those days. I should have posted my resume around mid-night EST. I got few replies immediately. But craziness happened the next day. My cell phone wonâ€™t stop ringing. My home answering machine was full with messages. There were folks who would send the job offer papers right away in the reply mail. I was amazed. So many people wanted to hire me. Here is another funny bit, my analysis of prospective employers was based on guess what, companyâ€™s press releases and reading analysts. I didnâ€™t knew\nPaul Kedroskyâ€™s views then\n\nWhile it was nowhere near as bad as it would eventually get in the late days of the tech boom, it was already obvious that technology equity analysts were becoming overpaid PR flacks. Our job was to dress up press releases in ornate prose chock-full of financial ratios and jargon and then parade them around. The ugly truth, however, was that we were pimps for investment banking business: Declining commissions and rapidly-rising technology stocks had conspired to turn us all into technology sluts.\n\nI finally arrived in Silicon Valley, all dreamy eyed. I was immediately hooked to CNet Radio. What a gem it was. You would get all the news while stuck in traffic jam on I-880. Both sides of 101 were totally crammed with billboards of all these companies. I would often think of them as, man I could have started that. Andy Kesslerâ€™s reasoning for so many billboards is quite right\n\nThe only thing slowing the growth of Momo funds was the lack of names. You could only put away so much Dell or Cisco until you owned the whole damn company â€“ so Momos turned to Wall Street and begged for new names. Wall Street didnâ€™t have to be asked twice â€“ and took public via IPO anything that wasnâ€™t nailed down â€“ and nothing having to do with the Internet was nailed down, no matter how stupid.\n\nI was part of the generation who got swanky jobs even in their early twenties. What was there to hate about it. But then shit happened. Luckily for me it just meant switching few employers. The money I lost is not even worth whispering. Now after five years I have these stories of wild parties, kids buying luxury cars and a bubble I was part of.

One reads books and papers and gossips and goes about passing conventional judgments on current events, One has a family, a profession, a circle of friends, and some hobby to keep one occupied in leisure time. One grows old, collects one’s own share of diseases, and looks back with anguish towards earlier days when one was young and active. For most of us ordinary mortals, this is the whole of human life. We take very seriously our successes and failures and our loves and hates, without spending a thought on what it is all about.”\nThough on a higher frame of reference i.e. about life it is true.

I’m pretty sure they all have a #flatrate for their mobiles… #ensw\n  \n  \n    — Matthias Steiner (@steinermatt) May 24, 2013\n  \n\n&nbsp;\nSince I have been doing cloud and pricing for the past few years I had few thoughts on this. Pricing is an art and science combined. To understand let me start with a story from my childhood. If you have even been to India and bought anything from a bazaar you know you never pay the first price the vendor asks for. As a kid I would see my elders haggling over the prices of everything. One fine afternoon my elder brother was buying shoes for me and he got the vendor from Rs 250 to Rs 90 (early 80s good times I know). After getting the shiny shoes for me I asked him how does he came to the figure of Rs 90 and he told me about he thought about\n\nthe cost of material, labor and margin\n\nand Rs 90 seemed like a good price. I internalized this concept and lived with it for years. Then I came to US and I noticed all sorts of pricing. Apparel pricing where they would be “fully priced” in spring, some what discounted in summer and deeply discounted by Autumn. Air ticket pricing was black magic. So read a few books[1][2] and about marginal cost of producing something but then finally settled on the idea of pricing as\n\nwhat someone is ready to pay for\n\nThis concept of what someone is ready to pay for is a great one. I mean if for the same necktie one person pays $50 and the other would gladly pay $80, I would like to sell accordingly. But how do I know who would pay how much. This is a really hard problem to solve and is the reason you see a regular cup of coffee for $2.00 while the white caramel macchiato with soy milk costs $4.50 at your favorite coffee joint. You don’t think that extra stuff costs the seller $2.50. It is their way of segmenting the customer and see who would pay more or who derives how much value.\n\nThe above concept works great where perceived value can be shown by adding attributes or services like models of cars, versions of software. But there are markets where doing this segmentation is a little hard. Utility markets for water, electricity and gas are great example of this. One Kwh hour of electricity is indistinguishable from another (though you can still bring in time of the day, how it was produced for some fun). These are the markets that are ripe for pay as you go. You could have tiered pricing over here as well. In cloud computing IaaS and PaaS models (compute units, storage, API calls etc) closely remember this utility model and we see similar pricing models as well.\nThere is one very important characteristic that dictates the PAYG model for clouds is that of elasticity and efficient use of resources. See in the on-premise model, an organization plans for the peak capacity and buys hardware accordingly (capex). But that peak performance might happen only 10% of the time or even lesser. So these resources are underutilized. But the organization has already bought so not much can be done (though for very large organizations a private cloud can be a choice). Now in the cloud PAYG model most of time you are working under a normal load and paying accordingly. If there is spike in the demand resources are added elastically and you pay for what you use. The same resources that you utilized during the peak time could be repurposed for other organizations during your average load profile.\nAnother alternative pricing model is of packaging where for commercial reasons or adoption reasons a seller might choose to package the resources in bundles and sell it. For example cell phone plans are great examples of this. These are valid models but fail the elasticity options discussed above as what happens when there is spike in demand. Sometimes you might see unlimited plans (cell phone, ISPs) but then you get into fair use of the resources ( recently a guy was using 50TB of bandwidth on Verizons FIOS plan).\nIn the end I would say utility like evolving nature of cloud resources and elasticity is what drives the clouds to PAYG models. We can also thank AWS for setting up the precedent.\n[1] The Undercover Economist – Tim Hartford (light reading pop science)\n[2] Principles of Microeconomics – Greg Mankiw (heavy dry university text)\nCoffee Ratecard image by –&nbsp;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nataliejohnson/3017624698/\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/cloud-pricing-and-pay-as-you-go-model/","path":"/blog/cloud-pricing-and-pay-as-you-go-model/","title":"Cloud pricing and pay as you go model"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/cloudnative-run-better-faster/":{"body":"\nDJ Adams started the conversation about cloud native on his recent post. Having seen the journey of SAP Cloud Platform from JPaaS days to present I have certainly been close to the principles and patterns that are now called “Cloud Native” I started commenting on DJ Adams blog and it got so long that I thought of writing it as a post in itself so here we go.\nBefore delving in to details of “Cloud native” let’s setup some context on why it is important at all for businesses. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and now highly respected venture capitalist at a16z made a rallying call when he wrote “Why Software is eating the world” One of the main argument he made was that all businesses will become software businesses. You can see manifestations of that all around - more and more things has software in them, larger chunk companies are driving a significant growth in their revenues enabled by software. There are countless examples of impact of software in various industries. One really good thread on this on twitter is by&nbsp;@SuB8u. This entire thread as well as this search is filled with software disruptions&nbsp;\n\nTech is impacting every industry. The smarter incumbents adapt, the lazier ones fall behind.http://t.co/mWFYQ0FU3P pic.twitter.com/CjltaxQq2L\n— Subrahmanyam KVJ (@SuB8u) July 18, 2015\n\nStated this way software has become an existential fact for organizations and it would be very important for businesses to be effective at software processes i.e. my title run better, faster. To understand this let us consider a modern development workflow based on DevOps toolchain -&nbsp;\n\nPlan - code - build - test - release - deploy - observe - maintain\nThis toolchain is based on the expectations from software in today’s ever connected world where people, things and businesses use software for everything. This could be from ordering lunch, booking a place to stay, checking supplier inventory to performing automated repairs etc. Apart from basic requirements of being always there (availability, graceful fallback) and not break (resiliency) there is also the added expectation of faster response to customer demands (meaning newer functionality and not the latency, though smaller latency is also good). In this context let’s look at two of the most important ideas from where the cloud native principles have emerged\n\nNeed for speed and Shorter Feedback Cycles for the win (faster..)\nIf you want to get from idea to market the fastest way you better have very short cycle of delivery baked with continuous feedback cycles. You may have a grand idea but do you want to deliver it in a meaningful incremental way (MVP anyone) or you want to do one big grand delivery with a high chance of not understanding customer requirements or they have changed since you started. The shorter feedback and deployment cycles also help in reducing risk. To do software with shorter delivery and feedback cycles you would need some concepts/patterns like\n\nOn demand and preferably code driven self service for the services and resources (compute, storage, databases etc.) needed for your solution. It won’t be fun if you are still waiting for the PO to be approved or have logistics problems with the delivery of servers or the data center power has not been provisioned correctly. &nbsp;\nYour software solution inhouse developed or bought has its own code/binaries/artifacts along with a lot of prerequisites/dependencies. It would be really nice if we had a standard way to package all of this in some format that would run everywhere (almost). Containers are here to help and their image definitions provide such a solution. There are a lot of other benefits as well but that’s a topic for another post.\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines that would build, test and feed these artifacts to the applicable runtimes.\n\nOperationally Efficient (run better..)\nWe want to run our solutions the most efficient and economical way. These efficiencies could be from the infrastructure side which is easy to procure/operate/deprecate/upgrade or on the human side i.e. doesn’t require a lot of grooming from humans, has a lot of resiliency or at least graceful degradation built into it so as to avoid 2am calls. There are three concepts we should consider here -\n\nEvolution of Acitivies - I was first introduced to these by Simon Wardley, concept itself is based on his own research and built on Difffusion of Innovation&nbsp;by Everett Rogers (Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore is also based on this). Idea is that most of the technology goes thru an evolution curve from relatively unknown genesis to ubiquitous utitlity as shown below\n\nYou can see this in from batteries to electricity, Telegraph to hundreds of ways to communicate today and finally computing from Z3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer) to cloud today. Other components needed in software solutions like databases, application servers are also going thru similar evolution and are being offered as services or utility. At any point of time it is best (mostly) to use latest in evolution. For example should I get electricity from utility (Solar is challenging this) or produce my own, should I setup my own datacenter or buy from cloud etc.&nbsp;\nStandardization - As anything moves from left to right on the evolution curve to be more efficient you start seeing standardization of various components. This is the context in which containers fit. You have one standard way to package and deploy software with all the dependencies baked it.\nOrchestration - We already covered Building, testing and packaging (CI/CD, containers) the software so that it can be run as efficiently as possible. This task of running efficiently falls under a concept called orchestrator. This orchestrator takes our software packaged as a container and runs it and makes sure that it keeps running. This keep it running is a big part and consists of monitoring, making sure the response time is good, based on the creterions defined by the operators scale up or down the application, provide health checks etc.\nThere are quite a few other related concepts that I can talk about like microservices, observability, API first etc. but I think we have a covered a lot of ground with talking about need for speed and how to operate in this faster changes + shorter feedback context. Let’s try to tie in all these for a TL:DR version.\nAll businesses are becoming software businesses while needing to respond faster to customer demands and operate efficiently to grow and compete. This resulted in changes in how to code/build/test/package software (12factor apps, CI/CD, containers) and how best to operate software (orchestration, observability) with the benefits of scalability, resilience and with shorter feedback cycle. Cloud native approach incorporates all of these to plan, build and operate software which is easier to change, resilient and graceful to unexpected situations.\nI hope this was useful to you. Please do share your feedback in the comments. I hope to write in more details about some of the concepts individually.\nCross Posted at SAP Community\nReferences\nCloud Native Attitude ebook by Anne Currie\n12 Factor Apps -&nbsp;https://12factor.net/\nCloud Native Trail Map from cncf.io - This is a really useful map and covers all the important concepts for your cloud native journey\nPhoto Credits\nThor Photoby JD Hancock\nEvolution Activities curve by Simon Wardley\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/cloudnative-run-better-faster/","path":"/blog/cloudnative-run-better-faster/","title":"Cloud Native - Run better, faster"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/collective-iq/":{"body":"Few weeks back I attended Future Salon for the first time.

So if we tag, bookmark or share, and help del.icio.us or Technorati or Yahoo become better commercial entities, arenâ€™t we seemingly commoditizing our most valuable asset – time. We become the outsourced workforce, the collective, though it is still unclear what is the pay-off. While we may (or may not) gain something from the collective efforts, the odds are whatever â€œthe collective effortsâ€ are, they are going to boost the economic value of those entities. Will they share in their upside? Not likely!\n\nComing to Om’s point of being the outsourced workforce – there has to be something for this to work. So far del.icio.us, technorati have been hugely successful. Any successful transaction involves give and take. If I create a link pointing to AJAX, there are thousands other links created by the community in the same area for me to see. Naturally I got the benefit of that collective work.

Future of libraries and books is something I think often. Let us say everytime I visit the local library. Here is there thinking on why reading book should be more like going to cinema rather than owning a physical artifact. You can always argue that there are folks who like to own discs/tapes but that would be minority compared to folks who see the movie.\n\n“Here is the central fact about book publishing: lending is the natural state. Authors produce a book that is improved by others (including editors etc). Then people read the book and that is where it has primary value. Notice that there is no ‘then people buy the book’ stage in the middle or ‘then people place the book on their shelves forever more’ after these. Those are things people did because (a) they had to buy a physical copy and (b) they got used to keeping the physical copy. But for libraries, none of that was relevant.\nThe issue book publishers face — and so many have said it I really shouldn’t bother, but I will — is that they are wedded to a strategy whereby they sell owned copies rather than reading. That model did translate over to eBooks and, in many respects, eBooks are actually harder to share as owned copies than physical books. Amazon and others have tried to break those constraints but it is safe to say that sharing is hard. Although, when you have a family account things become simpler. But institutionalised lending of eBooks may be very attractive to readers.”\n\nLending is the right model | Digitopoly\nDigitopoly. About; Authors. Erik Brynjolfsson; Joshua Gans; Shane Greenstein.

So close your eyes and imagine you’re holding an iPod. Now take away iTunes, take away the ability to buy the song you like for 99¢ without having to pay $15 for a dozen more on a CD you don’t want, lose the ability to create play lists, cut out the packaging, take out the ads, delete the Apple logo, and shutter all the Apple stores. The remaining question is, “Do you still have an iPod?” Yes, the physical product in your hand is exactly the same, but what do you have now? Really, what do you have?\nWell, you have a nicely designed object. Is it an iPod still? No, it’s not, because an iPod is a portal to a kaleidoscope of experience. An iPod is not just an object. The object is an icon that is a portal to an experience.\n\nSo essentially what is being talked over here is a total customer experience.

For example for an enterprise software vendor it would be the software itself, how it was sold, how it was implemented, how is the maintenance support provided, how are trainings held for users, user conferences and these days how vibrant is the online community etc.\nWhile all of this is good and very helpful way of making the product and services highly successful. There is one small lurking doubt I have in the corner of my mind. Apple very tightly controls almost all attributes about its offerings. Obviously it has been very successful in the consumer electronics space. But can this be extended everywhere where the producer/provider cannot have such a fine control for various reasons.\nHat Tip: I was introduced to the book by Core 77’s design blog this post.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/enabling-total-customer-experience/","path":"/blog/enabling-total-customer-experience/","title":"Enabling total customer experience"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/et-tu-plumtree-and-end-of-pure-play-portal-vendors/":{"body":"In the rosy days of late nineties there were three pure portal play companies. Plumtree, Epicentric and Toptier. Then sometime in late 2000 SAP decided to complement there technology platform with a portal offering. They acquired Toptier for whopping $400 millions and married it with their existing portal product called workplace. This was a great buy for SAP as the acquired product has now morphed in the very mature people layer of SAP’s Netweaver platform.\nThen somewhere in 2002 came Epicentric’s turn and it got acquired by Vignette for $32 millions. Vignette complemented their content development platform with the content delivery platform via Epicentric.\nToday I read the news of Plumtree’s acquisition by BEA via Phil Wainewright’s excellent Loosely Coupled blog. It is sad in the sense that there is no major Pure Play Portal vendor left in the field  But does that mean being pure portal vendor is not viable in today’s economic scenarios. You got to be an applications vendor and club portal as delivery platform. SAP has a whole slew of applications to be delivered via portal i.e. CRM, BW, HCM, SCM, and SRM etc. Vignette has while not a business application vendor has the content management system up its sleeve. \n\n\nThis gives rise to the question what application does BEA has? But again BEA has been a pure technology platform vendor. What perplexed me as rightly pointed by Phil in LCBlog was the decision to keep BEA’s existing portal separate from Plumtree stack.\n“We now have leadership in both transactional and collaboration portals” Chuang said.\nBoth Chuang and Carges stressed that BEA will maintain separate portal offerings. “We will have two separate portal product lines for as long as we can see,” Carges said. \nKeeping both the products separate would mean more pain for the customers in maintaining and operating two separate stacks. It would be interesting to see how long both of the stacks remain separate from each and how they evolve.\nLast a disclaimer I have been a SAP Portals consultant for the last four years and naturally I have a strond bias towards SAP Portal which I consider the best positioned platform sitting at the top in SAP’s Netweaver Platform’s People layer. Also it would have been more interesting if Oracle had bought Plumtree 😀\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/et-tu-plumtree-and-end-of-pure-play-portal-vendors/","path":"/blog/et-tu-plumtree-and-end-of-pure-play-portal-vendors/","title":"Et Tu Plumtree and end of pure play portal vendors"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/everybodys-loves-documentation/":{"body":"Being a consultant you are constantly, though rightfully, asked by the clients to document everything before you leave.

It could be a carpenter working on wood or a coder tapping on the keyboard. Browsing thru the excellant Santa Clara City Library I came across this book – Execution-the dicipline of getting things done. The word execution immediately struck a chord in me and brought the same feeling I wrote earlier. When I checked out the book from library, I was thinking of execution at a personal level. But it turned out focus of the book is much larger and it is execution at the organization level. In other words it is a good book for CEOs. But then somewhere in everyone there is this feeling to be one someday. So it was a good education to me on what CEOs face in day to day life. How organizations work and what does is the best way to run them. \nAuthors have broadly divided the organizations into People, Strategy, and Operations. Of course People are the most important part of an organization, they are the ones who make strategies which are then turned into operational plans. Strategy is a much abused word in consulting business I work. The booked helped me align my thoughts on what really is a strategy what a CEO talks about. Strategy is what turns an idea like “we need to have product for this” to reality. Finally Operations is step by step action plan to walk down the path given by strategy.\nIt was not an easy book to read for me. At various points I would stop and think about what the author’s are trying to say and how would a real life situation like that would be. Again I have never thought as an executive. My work plan is limited to get this solution implemented as decided during the blue print phase while managing the client expectations. So this book for me was also a peep into he CEO’s mind. I guess I need to widen my perspective.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/execution-the-dicipline-of-getting-things-done/","path":"/blog/execution-the-dicipline-of-getting-things-done/","title":"Execution the dicipline of getting things done"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/feed-computers-were-all-outside-the-body/":{"body":"I first read about “Feed by MT Anderson” at FutureSalon.

Idea was to share some of the thoughts, best practices etc. that I have gained over the years. During the last few years I have been to many places, got to be part of exciting teams, different work environments etc. One thing that has remained constant is two golden rules that were told to me by Michael Chio, an excellent consultant on my very first consulting gig in Bay Area. I have lost touch with him over the years but I still remember his golden advice. Here they are\nNever Say No – Never say a out right no to what is asked from you. Besides isnâ€™t it true that given enough time and effort most of things can be done. Even in cases where you know that this task cannot be done, ask more questions to about the task, get more clarifications of the variables of the problem being asked. It may be the case that you haven’t understood the problem. If still you think the answer is no give enough simple and clear reasons why the task can not be done.\nDo not panic – this might be written on the front page of Hitch Hiker’s guide to galaxy but it is also true in consulting world. You might have blown away the last week’s effort but do not I repeat do not panic. Your panic situation will send an exponentially higher signal to the client. There is nothing worse than a consultant panicking in front of a client. Analyze the reasons it happened and what you need to do to resolve this.\nI have added a third rule to this\nCommunicate – Humans like to talk. It is very important that you are talking about your progress with your client. You might be doing a yeoman’s job but without communication it might not be as worthful. It doesn’t help to just sit there and do your job one needs to talk to peers and higher ups.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/golden-rules-of-consulting/","path":"/blog/golden-rules-of-consulting/","title":"Golden rules of consulting"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/good-investment-advice-from-bogle/":{"body":"\n  But one of the ideas behind the 401(k) was, “you can do it!” You own it; you run it. And you’ve got millions of people out there saying, “I can beat the averages.” What do you say to that?\n\n\n  I say, don’t kid yourself, pal. Look, it’s so simple. We’re not like the kids out in Lake Wobegon. As investors, we are all average, and as investors, we all share the stock market’s return. It’s going to turn out to be 8 percent return, we’re all going to share 8 percent return, but only before costs are deducted. We all share the market’s return less the cost of the financial system. All those management fees and brokerage commissions and sales loads and God knows what else is thrown in there — the advertising that you see.\n\n\n\n\n  The evidence is profound that mutual fund investors make terrible errors in terms of timing. They want to pour money into the stock market when it’s high, and they want to pull it out when the market is low. They make terrible errors on fund selection. They want to buy funds that have done the best, and then when they do the worst they want to switch out of them and get into something else that is then doing the best. All that shuffling around is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing but losses for the investor.\n\n\n  … Then another place we have really gone awry is we now offer people basically a nice little shotgun by which they can commit suicide: We have given them brokerage accounts, and you can run a brokerage account in your 401(k) plan. So you can then buy individual stocks and go back and forth and do all the insane things that so many investors do all the time.\n\n\n  So we have taken a system that should be simple — own the stock market and hold it forever; if you like bonds a little more as you get older, have more in bonds, and hold it forever — [and] now it’s pick and choose and select and move money back and forth, even to the point of where you can pick individual stocks and pick your company’s stock, which is a big part of the 401(k) problem, and issue; you can do that, too. It’s a system that really needs to be fixed, and badly.\n\nThis is from an interview over here Bogle also has a blog over here.

If your manager says yes, investigate the tolerable downtime and economic loss of unavailability (you need to justify the cost of setting up an HA cluster).\n1b.

Sums up pretty well at the end\n\nMy Take: I would think yes in three ways, A. By creating a huge industry, technology is defintely creating new buisness value and by extension helping the stakeholders. B. By making life better fot the society as a whole C. Tech industry is one of the fastest innovators and so is able to roll out newer solutions/products faster – in the process helping society at large happy by providing new variety!!.\n\nAnd here is my take on it 😀 I have often wondered about the happiness. During the surveys that James Surowiecki articles talks about when people were asked about happiness were they thinking about fun or happiness. It is quite too often that one would confuse between the too. To me real happiness is like looking at one’s kids, getting the love of one’s life etc. Having fun would be visiting Disney world, taking the roller coaster ride etc. It is this fun that looses its novelty just too easy. After being on a ride on 30 feet roller coaster you want to have a bigger thrill, so you go for 50 feet and so on.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/happiness-and-fun/","path":"/blog/happiness-and-fun/","title":"Happiness and fun"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/happy-diwali/":{"body":"Happy Diwali to every one.

LCD TVs were becoming quite mainstream at that time and anything above 46 inches were more than 2000 bucks. Spending that much requires some research and I landed on avsforum’s LCD forum.&nbsp;I bought the TV but discovering avsforum was a discovery for gadget loving geek. I will come to that later. Watching TV on 52 inches of LCD was a revelation. Around the same time my little daughter came into the world and there was explosion of cute pictures and HD videos. To watch them on the TV I bought a media player called WDTV&nbsp;&nbsp;which could show me all the media I had on the hard disk attached to it as well as youtube etc.\nSince I had discovered avsforum I kept going back to it for reading various things audio video. I found out that due to their thinness LCD TV have poor speakers so one should get external speakers. For watching movies, speakers should really be in at least 5.1 config. Of course to drive these speakers you need a good audio receiver. While I am grokking the intricacies of audio systems and looking at to get a home-theater-in-a-box or separate speaker and&nbsp;receiver I browse to the home theater PC area of avsforum. Being a computer guy it is even more fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;So now it is 2009 and it has been more than a year I have bought the Samsung 52″ LCD TV. And I am totally sucked into the AV world. Thanks to avsforum.\nSo far I only have the TV and a media player WDTV. &nbsp;But I am also exploring if I should get speakers, audio&nbsp;receiver and may be a HTPC. Reasoning behind HTPC is to have the browsing capability to stream anything you want as WDTV can only stream youtube and couple of other services. While I am in the wait and see mode, there comes a deal at Fry’s a local store for Onkyo home theater in a box for quite cheap. Specs look good with some decent speakers and 4 HDMI ins and I buy that on a whim. Then Google announces Google TV. A friend who works at Logitech is able to get me Revue.\nGoogle TV with Revue is good and it has the Chrome browser where I can browse, stream all I want. It integrates nicely with the Onkyo receiver I have. Netflix, Amazon VOD integration is even nicer. I really like the way search results are overlayed on live TV and the picture in picture is nice. Having used WDTV I am used to the really nice interface to browse local media i.e. pictures and videos. This is where Google TV sucks – while it is great for online media browsing app for local media is not so good. I have to keep WDTV and Google TV while what I want is a single box for every thing. My desire now for HTPC grows even further. So I start doing the final research for building the HTPC and looking for all the components that would go into it. AVSForum’s HTPC forum is the ultimate source for it. Two threads on this forum\n\n&nbsp;renethx&nbsp;‘s&nbsp;**Guide to Building a HD HTPC&nbsp;**and\nassasin &nbsp;‘s&nbsp;Assassin’s Simple/Beginner HTPC Buying and Building Guide\n\nare my main sources.

I choose to go for SSD for the OS and programs drive. Really like the choice of Silver Stone GD06 case I made. But that required me to buy a modular power supply and shorter cable set. I was able to repurpose one of my external 1TB USB drives by opening it and using it as a main storage. Keyboard/Remote choice was based on online reviews. iPazzport is a good looking small form factor RF based remote. Performance is average.

Had to play with cables a lot for that.&nbsp;Couple of interesting things I learnt during this built. CPU needs it own power. Didn’t knew that and started the PC without that connection. Took some time to figure that out. One should always have a real keyboard handy to configure the PC for 1st time. SATA Blu ray players have separate SATA connectors for data and power. It was hugely satisfying once the HTPC was built and connected with the TV. I ended up spending more than $1000 but it was worth it \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/htpc-2/","path":"/blog/htpc-2/","title":"Building HTPC 2 Components"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/htpc-3/":{"body":"(This is the last of this HTPC build series do read the Part 1 – HTPC Research and Part 2 – HTPC Build )\nAfter researching for almost 3 years HTPC was finally built and is the center of my audio video setup.

He must have been a remarkable teacher to have so many great students who themselves are leading life lessons for so many. I have been listening to podcasts by Ajahn Brahm for more than a year. He is a student of Ajahn Chah based in Australia. His podcasts and videos on youtube have been listened/watched by millions. I have learnt a lot from his teachings.\nToday when starting for work I looked for my listening diet for the fifty minute commute and settled on Tim Ferris show. From the title it was about meditation, joy in the present the regular mindfulness things. Guest was a guy names Jack Kornfield. I didn’t really had many expectations except to be good talk as Tim chooses the best :-) And what a surprise it turned out to be. Of course Jack is a student of Ajahn Chah. He had amazing stories to tell. I have only listened to an hour of the episode and that is only 1/3 of the episode. Few of the notable things\n\n“My mind is like a bad neighbourhood, I don’t want to go there alone”,\nMoving story from Kymer Rouge time and Maha Ghosananda in Combodia.\nJack’s childhood stories.\n\nLooking forward to listening to the rest.

PCQ didn’t even had a website then. I had to go on my bicycle to Sector 16 in Chandigarh to get that PCQ with a CD. I instantly fell in love watching those sorting applets showing the power of threads. Even in professional life I have used Java the most be it for making custom apps or apps based on SAP’s Solutions. Also my first blog was on JRoller.\nBut when it came to creating my own blog in my own domain. I settled first for MovableType and then moved on to WordPress. Both based on scripting languages. There were quite a few reasons that I chose to go this route. I will list few of them over here\n\n\nEconomy The biggest one was as usual the money. It is cheaper to host a php/perl based solution which is based on how much resources an ISP has to put to support a solution. For scripting based apps the CPU usage is only momentary when the site is accessed (Do I hear people saying dude what about scalability) while for Java based first of all JVM is running all the time. Secondly you really want your own JVM. Last thing you want is someone else’s application has hung crashed the JVM and no one can access your site.\n\n\nMaintenance Again IMO there are more pieces in the Java side of the puzzle then are there on the scripting side. More the pieces more the complexity more single point of failures. For a single person hosting an app with few users it is too much to maintain 😉\n\n\nAll said and done I would say that if I had go for a blogging solution for one of our corporate clients I would be first one to jump on suggestiing Roller Weblogger or Pebble(though I don’t have personal experience with this). First Corporations won’t be as cheap as me so reason number one is blown secondly they have the neccessary resources to maintain these application. Moreover companies would already have people experienced with server side java app management.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/javaphp/","path":"/blog/javaphp/","title":"To Java or PHP is the question"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/kindle/":{"body":"There is an article on NYTimes about how the age of Kindle or e-bookreaders is going to impact the old-fashioned books and the culture associated with book reading. Much of the article is devoted to the physical nature of books and the signals it sends to people around the person reading the book. For example if I have all my library in Kindle how would others be able to see what I have been reading and infer what sort of a person I am. In another case while traveling seeing another person carry your favorite book makes instant connections.\nWhile I won’t miss these things about books as physical objects. What I would definitely miss is the impact books have when one is growing up with a lot of books around. Some of the earlier books I read were not recommended to me by any one. I happen to read them as they belonged to my elders and were readily available in the house. As a kid when you have spare time you just pick what is around and read it. With ebook readers it is going to be tough. Another thing that concerns me about ebook readers how it is going to impact libraries. I hope I would still be able to borrow books from library the way I do today. May be even better that I won’t have to go to library physically.\nAs far as the touting the books you are reading in front of your network – it has already been taken care by the “new media”.

LooselyCoupled is all about how IT landscapes should be loosely coupled, with best of breed applications from different vendors and all systems talking to each other via standard and open services. I would call it a heterogenous environment. Having being trained as an engineer my mind makes me beleive this is the ideal concept. I agree it is beautiful concept. There is so much freedom to replace and put a new system. Vendor lock in is totally avoided. But then we live in a real world and as human beings we are rather lazy. Last few years I have spent in the consulting world, working with different clients all across the US, one thing I have found is that companies want to standardize their systems. For example for notebooks we are going to purchase Thinkpads, we will only use Oracle databases, or even all our consultants would come from this company. I can understand the reason for all this having fewer parties to talk reduces the process load on company employees. Similarly large enterprises tend to choose one or two vendors for their business applications. Besides dealing with the same company added benefit is easier integration across the products from same vendor. This is what I call a homogenous enterprise. While what I said above might not be true for all the companies but IMHO this happens at a lot of companies. It is the best way or not is debatable.\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/looselycoupled/","path":"/blog/looselycoupled/","title":"Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous IT environment"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/lordpec/":{"body":"Recently few good folks from PEC, my college started an online forum at pecobians.com.

And maybe someone unrelated to PEC might find it useful. So here it is\n———–\nDear Lord PEC\nI have been meaning to write this email for a while. Now that it is weekend over here I can write it.

Here is some text from that email\n==START EMAIL SNIP==\nNow to the PEC project. What I am thinking is to club togather a bunch\nof folks from PEC who have net access and ask them to blog about\nDay-to-day-PEC.

They have no magic to stir men’s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big.”\nWhen you are ready to make your mark in the world, keep these words in mind. Too often, we are happy with the mundane, the ordinary. All around, we see mediocrity. People are happy being good. Good is the enemy of Great. We get into a groove, a comfort zone, and stay there. Donâ€™t. We live only once. Dream big. We are where we are today only because a few in our past dared to think different and envision a world that could be.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/make-no-little-plans/","path":"/blog/make-no-little-plans/","title":"Make No Little Plans"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/making-of-the-wordpress-empire/":{"body":"It is interesting to see the new architecture of wordpress.

If you work with enterprise software, like I do, names of large German software vendor or the one here locally from Redwood City or up in the North of bay area may start popping in your head. But I would say think a little bit more. Consider this, the application being talked about is used by millions of users, across operating systems, hardware platforms with so much ease that even the metaphorical grandmas can use it. The application is blogging engines like WordPress, MovableType or Blogger. All these engines have evolved in a service oriented framework without consciously keeping the SOA approach in mind. A typical engine offers the following services\n\nRSS – RSS was the first service offered by blogging engines and was also picked up later by websites. It was a really simple idea whose time had come. It allowed content of one site to be used in other sites. All one has to do was to publish small xml file with some excerpts of the new content and links to it. These xml files or RSS feeds as they are called are later picked by various RSS readers or clients FeedDemon, NewsGator, Bloglines etc. One can also include RSS feeds of other blogs in other sites.\nXMLRPC  – While RSS allows the reading interface of a blog XMLRPC is publishing interface of a blog. Using this service you publish posts to a blog in particular category. There are various innovative blogging clients available that allow publishing from desktop (w:blogger, ecto) or browsers. I even hear that those lovely unix folks have developed a plugin for emacs so that they can publish from their favorite editor. Latest news is the Word 2007 supports this natively i.e. now anybody in the organization with Microsoft Office can publish to a blog directly.\nTrackback and PING – These are the alert services offered by these engine. If one author has written about writings of another author they can alert the author’s blog about it. One can also ping publicly available service that something new has been published. Again this gave rise to Technorati, Pingomatic etc.\nPublish by Email – While XMLRPC is the most widely used interface to publish content for blogs. There is another interface which allows to publish by sending the email. Now one can blog by sending email from crackberries.

This prompted me to look at my order history as I was sure I would be in the same boat. Going through the order history confirmed it. Now two consumers from the same geographic region don’t make a trend. But I suspect that this would be the case for a lot more people who are voracious consumer of information on the web i.e. heavy users of blogs, tweets and online news. Increase in spend in itself is not bad if it has merely shifted spending at brick and mortar to online spending for stuff. It would be bad ( at least for my pocket) if this 24/7 connectivity, 1000s of review sites, ease of online ordering has increased our wants and buying behavior.\nWhile buying clothes and food etc is not practical but buying gadgets, books, music, games and software etc is super easy. There is always a new batch of TVs with more features, digital cameras with HD video recording, AV receiver with newer version of HDMI, new notebooks, routers with wifi-n, ipads and iphones. Then there are techmeme, gizmodo, engadget, amazon etc to review it. For more hardcore guys there is dpreview and avsforum. And all of this in your smart phone, connected TV 24/7 at your service. I think all of this creates a never ending anxiety to upgrade stuff. Which is resulting in ever increasing line items in things-I-bought-last-winter list.\nGood or bad depends up the age old question about wants and needs.

What that means is we need to get the courts to move. Many trades donâ€™t occur because contracts cannot be enforced by a court system which has a reported backlog of about 300-odd years. Finally, we need to make people owners so that they can properly care for their charge and this they will do only if they have an incentive to perform their duty, which they will do if credible commitments can be made about public flogging.\n\nI was amused when he recommended public flogging as the way to mend public officials.

This got to be the best lines I read this week\n\nI think this viewpoint applies as well to the job of the novelist. Writers who are blessed with inborn talent can freely write novels no matter what they do—or don’t do. Like water from a natural spring, the sentences just well up, and with little or no effort these writers can complete a work. Occasionally you’ll find someone like that, but, unfortunately, that category wouldn’t include me. I haven’t spotted any springs nearby. I have to pound the rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of creativity. To write a novel I have to drive myself hard physically and use a lot of time and effort. Every time I begin a new novel, I have to dredge out another new, deep hole. But as I’ve sustained this kind of life over many years, I’ve become quite efficient, both technically and physically, at opening a hole in the hard rock and locating a new water vein. So as soon as I notice one water source drying up, I can move on right away to another. If people who rely on a natural spring of talent suddenly find they’ve exhausted their only source, they’re in trouble.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/pound-the-rock-and-dig-out-a-deep-hole/","path":"/blog/pound-the-rock-and-dig-out-a-deep-hole/","title":"Pound the rock and dig out a deep hole"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/pricing/":{"body":"One of the blogs I often read is Brad deLong’s Semi Daily journal. You can always find good discussions on various economic trends and news from Brad’s prespective on this site. In one of the stories he linked, it had the following line from original author\n\nThe Holy Grail in economics is that price should equal marginal cost\n\nI ended up spending more time in thinking about this line than I should have. Obviously my first attempt was to think about software pricing where this would fail miserably. The cost of producing next unit of software is practically nil. Infact this is true for any thing which can be made digital. This is the reason MPAA and RIAA are fretting over this so much for the music and movie copying.\nPricing is a very interesting topic. First instance of this would have been during the bartering system in the early stages of civilization. Initial pricing techniques must have been very simple. Some thing on the lines it costed me this much in producing 100 kilogram of onions. With this much as markup I should price this item this amount. Ofcourse the compitition should be kept in mind over here.\nThis simple concept must have taken drastic turn with the introduction of branding. I am not sure when the pricing technique of how much the customer would be willing to pay for this product/service would have come into practice. I guess it has been there since early ages  Here are few pricing scenarios\n\nStock valuation – the most crazy and weird thing in the world to price. Is Google really worth what it is now upwards of $300?\nSoftware Licenses – This is again a art.\nPrice difference between the similar quality branded and non-branded stuff.

In fact, there really aren’t street names on the streets – its just not intuitive to find. In order to find out what street you are on, you need to look at the business signs because some of them have the whole address printed on the sign. It really makes locating businesses/homes a little difficult. I read that Bangalore was built piece by piece. Each locality back then was built by a different ruler. So that’s why the city layout is so complex.\n”\nBTW most of the city landscapes are that way. Reading the addresses off the shop business signs is how I used to know which city I am while travelling by bus or train.\nI so miss the ease of going to doctors back home. On doctor visit\n“I called the reception to call a doctor. The doctor came and did a check up. The doctors here actually do house visits. That was great! Because I did not want to have to ride the bumpy roads just to get to one. The cost was $11 for the house visit (for the BEST doctor) and $3.33 for the medicine she prescribed. Wow! I was really impressed…I was feeling extremely sick and a couple of hours after I took the medicine I was feeling almost 80%. I was able to get up, my headache went away, and my swollen throat eased up. I was so amazed. This is the fastest recovery to any sickness I’ve ever encountered.”\nLife moves on\n“But now that I have moved into my own apartment, furnished it, found tofu, garlic powder, diet coke at a market just two minutes away, enjoying my 5 minute commute to work; I feel like I am now finally starting to feel and flow with the rhythm of life here. That is a beautiful feeling.”\nFinally a reader sums all my feelings in comments for one of the posts\n“I am from India and currently live in San Francisco..everytime I get sick I miss the Indian docs so much….U never have to hassle much for an appointment plus recovery is super fast..The medical and insurance infrastructure is very well established in US however it has its own drawbacks…Sometimes you have to wait for weeks to get an appointment with a specialist….\nAnyways, I like your blog..Its kinda reverse psychology and interesting for me to read…Hope you travel and enjoy better experiences in India..”\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/quid-pro-quo/","path":"/blog/quid-pro-quo/","title":"Quid pro quo"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/random-photo-testing-in-public/":{"body":"Random photo testing in public\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/random-photo-testing-in-public/","path":"/blog/random-photo-testing-in-public/","title":"Random photo testing in public"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/reading-mysap-crm-solution-for-success/":{"body":"I am reading this introductory book from SAP Press on SAP CRM.

After completing college education, only way to grow further is by reading books. But reading a book also means time commitment. Typically a week to few weeks of reading every day. So it becomes necessary to select books with care. Though there is always the option of reading few pages or few chapters but that also results in waste.\n\n  Over the years my book selection process has become somewhat refined. Before the advent of blogs or even web the way to find good books was word of mouth, newspapers or magazines. There were best seller lists and books of the year but that meant that one would miss good but obscure books. Also the books from past would be missed too. For example there is no way I was going to find about Thomas Schelling’s “Micromotives and Macro behavior” from best sellers list. With blogs this selection process has become really easy and very effective. Since one only subscribe to authors one likes iis quite likely that the books recommended by them on their blogs would be to your taste. And when one is fond of bibliophiles like Tyler Cowen of Marginal Revolution it is bonus time.\n\nMost of the blog authors when talking about books point to its page on big river aka Amazon. Once at Amazon it is easy to find what other’s are talking about the books in customer reviews. This is all good but what I am really excited about is the ability to check if the book is available at one of the branches of local Santa Clara County libraries (SCCL). This is possible by a little greasemonkey script on firefox that was written for Seattle Public Library which I improvised for SCCL.

I bought it because of the dot-com crash 😀 I was between jobs and company notebook was rightfully taken back by my earlier employer. I needed something to browse the internet and buying a notebook didn’t look like a good idea in those times. Then I get this call from my uber-geek friend Nikhil Goel who has chosen Singapore as his workplace, about one website offering Audrey’s at $99. I immediately ordered one. It was a god sent gift at that time. I loved it. I was only able to access net thru modem in its initial form. So I started visiting these websites for more info on how to attach a network card with it which turned out pretty easy. I had to buy a Netgear USB NIC and then spoof it’s MAC address or something to make it behave like 3Com gear :D. \nAudrey visits India\nThen afterwards I joined my next employer and got into the cruel 😉 consulting world. So now this audrey was sitting idle at home. I shipped it to India for my nephew. There he struck a snafu as there was still no broadband in Chandigarh, India circa 2002. Modem option which I was sure would work didn’t work as Chandigarh at that time had 6 digit phone numbers and Audrey was expecting 7 digit phone number. So poor Audrey sat there gathering dust.\nHomecoming\nThis year I asked another one of my buddies whose parents live in Chandigarh to get that Audrey back from India on his trip back home. So finally sometime this year Audrey came back. A lot of developments have happened in the Audrey Geekdom I was so happy to get it back, though my nephew thinks otherwise as his place has 7 digit phone numbers as well as broadband. My last month was spent first upgrading the Audrey’s OS using spoofed DNS so that I can get a shell. Then archiving the CF images and finally replacing it with images from one of the sites.\nSo many ways\nIt is amazing how people are using this little internet appliance. Hook it to a phone line and capture the Caller IDs, play MP3s (good case for listening to podcasts), act as a home automation device etc. Right now I want it to work with as USB wi-fi card so that I can put it in my kitchen and we can use it look for recipes, store the postit notes we put on the refrigerator. I don’t want to run a Ethernet cable from my router to this baby. I know I can always buy another wi-fi router and then bridge two routers and get a connection from second router.

While reading my daily dose of blogs I noticed Brij has mentioned Paul Krugman’s “The Great Unraveling” as a book to read. On my next trip to Santa Clara City Library I picked this book and am I glad to read this book.\nThe book is about corporate scandals and how for short term political benefits political parties can ransom the future. Authors approach of telling economic facts and theories is marvelous. Back in engineering school my good friend Arun Sharma used to say if you know a concept very well then you would be able to describe it by making common analogies. That’s what the professor does. I liked how in A Retirement Fable author writes\n\n“There once was a land where people lived only two years. In the first year they worked; in the second year they lived off their personal savings.\nThere came a time when the government decided to help out the elderly. So it instituted a system called Social Security”\n\nto talk about the impending social security crisis. Or how bulls and bears are described in The Ice Age Cometh. I smiled reading Two Thousand Acres when author concludes that\n\nAccording to my calculations, my work space occupies only a few square inches of office floor.

Very enjoyable read. My personal experience has been with the dot-gone bubble of late 90s and may be the present bubble or froth as quoted by Alan Greenspan in the real estate markets. Some of the excerpts from the chapter “Madness of Crowds” are so relevant that I am surprised we never seem to learn from old mistakes.\nConsider this when Burton G. Malkiel talks about the tulip craze and the call-options which happened in Holland in 1630s\n\n“Part of the genius of financial markets is that when there is a real demand for a method to enhance speculative opportunities, the market will surely provide it”\n\nIsn’t what markets did when every mom-and-pop dot.com company went IPO in the 90s or the interest only loans and adjustable ARMs of today.\nI am equally amazed at reading the story British South Sea Company and the South Sea Bubble. Can’t imagine its share between 1717-1722 went from 100 pounds to 1000 pounds and then back to nothing. Or how about the RCA shares back in America rose from $94.25 to $505 from March 3, 1928 to September 3, 1929; a cool 434.5% growth in 18 months. I think this beats the growth of modern day darling Google. That too when we are in correction mode after the 90s.\nThis last paragraph of the chapter is what is most intriguing to me. I have read something to the same effect in quite a few articles. But it still beats me how this can be so simple. The business of making more money from existing money or investing\n\nIt is not hard, really, to make money in the market. As we shall see later, investors who select a portfolio of stock listings in the Wall Street Journal can make fairly handsome long-run returns. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges.\n\nNotice the “really”.

It is an excellent and accessible read on getting to mutually agreeable outcome during negotiations ranging from salary to nuclear disarmament talks. For my present gig I commute between South San Francisco and San Jose on a not-so-enjoyable highway 101. Listening to books is a great way to utilize this time. In the book authors point out that one of the mistake parties make during the negotiation is just thinking about one’s own positions. Parties overlook the fact that the folks on the other side of table are humans too. Focusing on the basic human needs of security, appreciation, well being etc. would result in successful results for all parties.\nWhile keeping the human nature in focus during negotiation is definitely fruitful, but I think this principle can be applied in general to a lot more situations. Especially while talking to people in authority. For example students can keep this in mind while talking to professors. Most of the time students would be focused on their own world and think professors are this abstract entities who are after their life giving assignments, asking them to review and re-review their assignments. Same goes for employees towards their managers etc. How many times any one thinks that professors or managers may have a life too. With loving wife and kids may be a dog too.

And never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther.â€\n\nComing from Mr. Munger, incentives as the very first cause or bias in Human Misjudgment, learning about incentives is quite important. And now Tyler Cowen, an economist and author of very famous blog Marginal Revolution has written a complete book on incentives called â€œDiscover your inner economistâ€\n This 250 page book is quite an easy read and very accessible as Tyler has used the â€œMe factorâ€ to fullest extent. For me the most interesting part was about the signaling concept. As an analytical mind it is very difficult to rationalize stuff like why spend extra money flowers on valentineâ€™s or on diamonds. But when you consider signaling concept and what might be going in your partnerâ€™s mind it all makes sense 😀 thereby increasing your marital bliss.\nIf you live in a large metropolitan area like San Francisco bay area, Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Singapore or Delhi you would resonate a lot with the chapter on finding good restaurants. Next time you are looking for good food look for low rent areas and donâ€™t order what you can make at home.\nThere are other parts in the book about visiting museums, going to movies, dating and even saving the world. I finished the book over a regular weekend and was quite happy to read it. Gives a lot of talking points to talk with oneâ€™s peers to make one look smart (again me factor). Before ending the review a tip for the author. In the book Tyler wonders if sending a Christmas Card to his dentist who happens to be a Hindu an effective incentive.

There are those in the blog world that pronounce that mass media will be marginalized more and more as we move further along. Then there are those in the mass media like Forbes who dedicate a full issue for attacking the bloggers.\nMy personal belief is that a lot of stories in the blog world start by referring to something seen/read/heard from the mass media and then the author’s take on it. I am not saying that there is nothing original written in the blog world but rather there is good amount of let’s say filtering from Mass Media that happens. Posts about good stories get published a lot and get a lot of comments. While if the mass media committed a folly, it would be pointed out loud. Most of the blog writers do something else for a living while journalists or professional writers do it for a living so naturally they have more time to research and are generally better articulate in putting their thoughts on paper.

Initial words “FON is is wifi revolution” caught my attention I started reading more about it. It is a pretty interesting concept analogous to File-sharing networks. Here instead of sharing your files you are actually sharing your internet bandwidth so that FON members can utilize your bandwidth and surf the net while they are near you and you get the same benefits if you happen to be near a FONer. From there website\nFON is an integration of those wanting to contribute to free universal communication and solidarity. We are a usernet growing larger every time we exchange part of our bandwidth for the ability to connect to the bandwidth of other FON members, in every moment from every location in the world.\nPretty interesting.

You would see no-name companies go from small start to national international in matter of years. Venture Capital does wonders over here. Apple, Genentech, Google and Facebook are prime examples. (Sorry for Silicon Valley bias)\n2. Law of Land – is enforced and contracts are followed. Enron, Galleon Hedge Fund, Rajat Gupta etc no one is spared. ( Yeah yeah you can say a lot of folks responsible for Financial Crisis didn’t pay for what they let loose but still I think it is net positive than otherwise)\n3.

CELPEC is group of individuals who worked in one particular lab at Punjab Engineering College. One of the friends asked what is weblog and why should we start using it instead of our good ol’ mailing list at yahoo. What follows is my reply to him.\nHere is link to good introduction to weblogs, donâ€™t forget to also read part 2\nhttp://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002399.html\nThere are links to very good articles on blogging just in the beginning of part 1.\nI will also try to explain it in the context of CELPEC.\nWhat do we do on CELPEC:\nTalk about any thing and every thing, more on technology and related stuff. Idea is to have some form of conversation where one starts by saying â€œHey dude did you hear about this, or you know what happenedâ€ But this thing happens in the virtual world.\nWith weblogs in picture, idea will still remain the same. But we are opening our conversation to the whole wide web. So be sure that you donâ€™t want to put some thing like my company sucks. As it would be viewable to everyone, would be indexed by google, tracked and pinged by you donâ€™t know whom. But consider putting something like hey I have this neat theory about how Indiaâ€™s population can be reduced 😉 Or I read this book. You get the idea.\nHow do we do it:\nWith the CELPEC mailing list, it is a real simple interface, you send an email to a particular address, mailing list host accepts this email from certain predefined addresses, which were put there when we subscribed to it.\nWith CELPEC weblog, the most simple interface would be to visit the site http://blogger.com or whatever. Login to make a new entry and post to your heartâ€™s desire. This is the basic one.\nNow onto more exotic ones, almost all blogging systems provide something like â€œBlog Thisâ€. Idea is to have a link to your browser toolbar. You would see this orange symbol on google toolbar. This is really neat. You might be reading a website and you feel the urge to blog. You select some text of your interest on the webpage and click the â€œBlog Thisâ€ link on your tool bar. This would popup a window with the selected test and the link to it. Now you can enter your comments on this and publish this. It would be posted to your weblog.\nThird and most widely used by regular writers is to have clients like w:blogger (http://wbloggar.com) etc. These are your regular applications you give your server address and your credentials in the beginning. Then write stuff inside this client and once done press publish. Just like the above â€œBlog Thisâ€ interface your post is published and ready to pleasure worldâ€™s eyes.\nInteraction:\nOn the mailing list we simply reply if someone feels like and everybody gets the reply. Idea is limited to our selected group. But with weblogs your post is opened to the whole world and anybody can comment on it. Another nice and powerful feature is trackback. Let us say you read a post somewhere and you want to write about it, or you mentioned it in your blog. By using the trackback feature you can let the author of that post know that you have published an entry that references his post.\nHow do we get it or syndication:\nWith mailing list we get in our inbox. With blog, you can goto the site regularly to check if there is something new. But there is no fun in it. For this almost every weblog publishes a feed. For example celpec feed is at http://celpec.blogspot.com/atom.xml So there are weblog feed aggregators like SharpReader(http://sharpreader.net) where you can specify which weblogs you are interested in reading and just like your email client check this regularly to see if anyone has something new to say. There are online aggregators like http://www.bloglines.com/ also.\nHope this helps.

Let me start with a bit of history. I am not sure where I got interested in design. But few months of my life where my neurons would have been lit up enough that light was coming thru my ears must be when I came to US. You see I grew up in the India of middle 80s (feeling old :)) where the design must have been stuck in the five year planning&nbsp;commissions. There were the Ambassdor cars, Philips radios, HMT watches and Colgate tooth paste and things would remain the same till may be mid 90s. If a product was supposed to work some way it would for a very long time. Even now if you open some of the Haldiram Namkeen products readily available in US you would see how little attention is paid to usability of the product where design matters a lot.\nSo 1st few months in US were great from that perspective. I am a very curious person so I would notice the design in everything like how the medicine bottles can only be opened in certain ways, numerous designs of opening the wooden doors meant for gardeners, how the swimming pool chairs have stops for various angle of reclines and dual sided boxee remote etc. That was then, I still notice these design things but the aha moments have sort of reduced. But every now and then something comes up and I go wow.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n  \n    Any DIYer worth their salt would have dabbled with electronic circuits. Remember when you discovered breadboards for wiring. Those Electronics for You issues for folks who grew up in India. So yesterday I had had to give a b’day present and much to my lovely wife’s discomfort I chose a geek present. It is called Snap Circuits SC100. What they have is similar to a bread board. But what I really LIKED and that’s where the design bit comes – is the way they have solved the problem of joining and creating various circuits. As is clued by the name they used the good old Snap Buttons for making the connection between various components. So a kid of 8-108 ( recommended age group on their box) won’t have to fiddle with cutting the wires, joining and soldering etc.&nbsp;Very nice.\n  \n  \n    Essentially you have plastic breadboard with a grid. Instead of typical holes at the intersection of lines you have little plastic projections to which various components and giant plastic wires snap onto by using the buttons. They have a nice book with lots of projects starting from a simple circuit with a switch to on-off a LED to more complicated ones. Here is picture from flickr. Note the shiny buttons at the intersections. Who would have thought the buttons for your shirts will be used to make circuits. That is why design matters.\n  \n  \n    &nbsp;\n  \n","description":"","id":"https://pnarula.com/blog/why-i-love-design/","path":"/blog/why-i-love-design/","title":"Why I love design"},"https://pnarula.com/blog/wp-process/":{"body":"In the past year I have installed wordpress so many times that installation of it has become a very trivial process for me.
