If you work with enterprise software, like I do, names of large German software vendor or the one here locally from Redwood City or up in the North of bay area may start popping in your head. But I would say think a little bit more. Consider this, the application being talked about is used by millions of users, across operating systems, hardware platforms with so much ease that even the metaphorical grandmas can use it. The application is blogging engines like WordPress, MovableType or Blogger. All these engines have evolved in a service oriented framework without consciously keeping the SOA approach in mind. A typical engine offers the following services</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p><span style=font-weight:700><img align=right height=53 src=http://pnarula.com/images/bt/bloglines.gif width=224>RSS</span> – RSS was the first service offered by blogging engines and was also picked up later by websites. It was a really simple idea whose time had come. It allowed content of one site to be used in other sites. All one has to do was to publish small xml file with some excerpts of the new content and links to it. These xml files or RSS feeds as they are called are later picked by various RSS readers or clients FeedDemon, NewsGator, Bloglines etc. One can also include RSS feeds of other blogs in other sites.<p><span style=font-weight:700><img align=right height=136 src=http://pnarula.com/images/bt/performancing.png width=144>XMLRPC </span> – While RSS allows the reading interface of a blog XMLRPC is publishing interface of a blog. Using this service you publish posts to a blog in particular category. There are various innovative blogging clients available that allow publishing from desktop (w:blogger, ecto) or browsers. I even hear that those lovely unix folks have developed a plugin for emacs so that they can publish from their favorite editor. Latest news is the Word 2007 supports this natively i.e. now anybody in the organization with Microsoft Office can publish to a blog directly.<p><span style=font-weight:700><img align=right height=86 src=http://pnarula.com/images/bt/tecnorati.gif width=235>Trackback and PING</span> – These are the alert services offered by these engine. If one author has written about writings of another author they can alert the author’s blog about it. One can also ping publicly available service that something new has been published. Again this gave rise to Technorati, Pingomatic etc.<p><span style=font-weight:700>Publish by Email</span> – While XMLRPC is the most widely used interface to publish content for blogs. There is another interface which allows to publish by sending the email. Now one can blog by sending email from crackberries. Don’t you love it.</section></article></main><div id=button-container><a title="Go to the top of the page" class=no-hover-padding href=# id=top-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M3.293 9.707a1 1 0 010-1.414l6-6a1 1 0 011.414 0l6 6a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L11 5.414V17a1 1 0 11-2 0V5.414L4.707 9.707a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z"/></svg> </a></div><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied! </span><span class=hidden id=copy-init> Copy code to clipboard </span><script defer src=https://pnarula.com/js/copyCodeToClipboard.min.js></script></div><footer><section><nav class="socials nav-navs"><ul><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" href=https://pnarula.com/atom.xml> <img alt=feed loading=lazy src=https://pnarula.com/social_icons/rss.svg title=feed> </a></ul></nav><nav class=nav-navs></nav><div class=credits><small> Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org>Zola</a> & <a href=https://github.com/welpo/tabi>tabi</a> </small></div></section><div class="search-modal js" aria-labelledby=modalTitle id=searchModal role=dialog><h1 class=visually-hidden id=modalTitle>Search</h1><div id=modal-content><div id=searchBar><div aria-hidden=true class=search-icon><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M784-120 532-372q-30 24-69 38t-83 14q-109 0-184.5-75.5T120-580q0-109 75.5-184.5T380-840q109 0 184.5 75.5T640-580q0 44-14 83t-38 69l252 252-56 56ZM380-400q75 0 127.5-52.5T560-580q0-75-52.5-127.5T380-760q-75 0-127.5 52.5T200-580q0 75 52.5 127.5T380-400Z"/></svg></div><input aria-controls=results-container aria-expanded=false autocomplete=off id=searchInput placeholder=Search… role=combobox spellcheck=false><div class="close-icon interactive-icon" title="Clear search" id=clear-search role=button tabindex=0><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="m256-200-56-56 224-224-224-224 56-56 224 224 224-224 56 56-224 224 224 224-56 56-224-224-224 224Z"/></svg></div></div><div id=results-container><div id=results-info><span id=zero_results> No results</span><span id=one_results> $NUMBER result</span><span id=many_results> $NUMBER results</span><span id=two_results> $NUMBER results</span><span id=few_results> $NUMBER results</span></div><div id=results role=listbox></div></div></div></div></footer>
