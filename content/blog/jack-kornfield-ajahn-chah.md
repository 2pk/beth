It seems there is no running away from [Ajahn Chah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Chah) for me. He must have been a remarkable teacher to have so many great students who themselves are leading life lessons for so many. I have been listening to podcasts by [Ajahn Brahm](https://bswa.org/teachers/ajahn-brahm/) for more than a year. He is a student of Ajahn Chah based in Australia. His [podcasts and videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/BuddhistSocietyWA/videos) on youtube have been listened/watched by millions. I have learnt a lot from his teachings.

Today when starting for work I looked for my listening diet for the fifty minute commute and settled on [Tim Ferris show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). From the title it was about meditation, joy in the present the regular mindfulness things. Guest was a guy names Jack Kornfield. I didn't really had many expectations except to be good talk as Tim chooses the best :-) And what a surprise it turned out to be. Of course Jack is a student of Ajahn Chah. He had amazing stories to tell. I have only listened to an hour of the episode and that is only 1/3 of the episode. Few of the notable things 

>"My mind is like a bad neighbourhood, I don't want to go there alone", 
>Moving story from Kymer Rouge time and Maha Ghosananda in Combodia. 
>Jack's childhood stories. 

Looking forward to listening to the rest. You can find it [here](https://tim.blog/2018/03/05/jack-kornfield/). Might update this after listening all.
